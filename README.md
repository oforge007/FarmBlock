# FarmBlock
Decentralized farmsteads Onchain. 
This Idea is to pioneer a global economy centered on growing life with solar powered irrigation system. Super Foods like Quinoa, Millets, goji berries, golden berries, and others with negative carbon effect and great value to the campaign of ending global hunger will be prioritized.  Our Protocol will mint NFT representation of real Agro products everytime a new FarmBlock is created. This will bring life and real value to NFTs,  and help in building a sustainable and productive ecosystem for our community, while successfully combating drought challenges in farming. This idea will harness local communities to participate in this noble call to nature, as they get rewarded for tasks they successfully complete. FarmBlocks will be decentralized farmsteads and can be created in a proof of ownership model, where the bearer of a farm title deeds or ownership certificate will upload it with a geo-tag of its location, then a number of Guardians is required to verify the authenticity of the documents in real world before signing onchain to be validators and co-guardians of that Farmstead and FarmBlock.  Guardians, who are also validators can  create time-bound tasks with rewards, give yield reports, make proposals that manage strategies in the farmBlock portfolio, and share live casts in the FarmBlock.
